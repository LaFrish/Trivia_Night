I selected the trivia game as my project 1 subject. Mainly bc I just enjoy those more. I may regret my decision later. Over the weekend I found some designs that I could use so that would not take up project week time.

I am going to start small with just 3 topics with one question. If time permits, I will add 3 questions per round. But I am starting simple stupid so the game will be basic for stage 1.

bronze plan : trivia questions on the page
silver plan: being able to interact and answer the questions
gold plan: for the jquery animation to work and flow easily.
Platnium - timer , scoreboard and more questions.

Changing from jQuery to JavaScript DOM in the script.

Need to list out variables. Listing them in the psuedocode.


CORRECT USER STORIES
I as a player would like to see the score
I as a player would like to see the color of the buttons change if I were right or wrong
I as a player would like to see my score
I as a player would like to see the high score to beat
I as a player would like to see more graphics
